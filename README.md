# Anxiety Dataset Analysis 

## Project Overview 
I used a consumer behavior dataset in SQL to extract and organize data into Excel, which was then used to create a dashboard in Tableau. The process, including data cleaning and visualization, took approximately 5 hours.

## Dataset Used 
- <a href="https://github.com/SaeterosM/Data-Analysis-Project2/blob/main/anxiety_dataset.xlsx" > Anxiety Dataset </a>

## Questions
I analyzed an anxiety dataset to explore the various causes of anxiety and how they correlate with different factors, based on the following questions
- Average stress level based on age range and gender
- Occupation and its effects on Sleep, Heart Rate, and stress level
- What are the different age ranges and their average anxiety level?
- How do age ranges affect their lifestyle factors affect their stress level?

## Process
Analyze and ensure the data in the Excel sheet is organized and sorted according to the corresponding data type.
Import the Excel data into SQL to extract, create, and calculate new information.
Use the newly created information tables in Tableau to build a dashboard
